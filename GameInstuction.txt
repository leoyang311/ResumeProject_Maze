Welcome to the Maze Game!

To play/begin the test, click "Run Configurations" in the "Run New_configuration" drop-down menu
and switch the main class to the Maze with the arguments set to ExamplesMaze and the game will begin!

To move around the maze, use the arrow keys on your keyboard
To reset the board, press r on your keyboard and a new board will appear

As you move around the board, a light blue tile will fill the spaces that you have been through. When you go to the wrong way, the wrong steps will increase.

If you press "d", it'll show you the solution using Depth-First and if you press "b" it'll show you the solution using Breadth-First

At the bottom there will be a tracker of wrong steps made
When you reach the end of the maze, a "You Win!" screen will appear

Have fun!
